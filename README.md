# Tilli Web App:

Tilli Safety Tool Box comprises of 3 modules:

## Module 1: Feelings and Emotions (Launched)
- Learn to identify, label and express emotions and feelings
- Develop healthy coping strategies to manage big feelings

## Module 2: Trust (Launched)
- At the core of staying safe is knowing who and what to trust
- Understand what trust means, looks, and feels like 
- Practice tools like the trust circle to make safer choices 

## Module 3: Digital Safety (WIP)

Our 3 modules (and even the modules you create in the Tilli IDE) can be accessed or reviewed with a Web browser over the World Wide Web on any mobile device. Unlike classical game software, browser-based games can be played instantly and do not require a prior installation!
